the most merciful thing in the world i think is the inability of the human mind
to correlate all its contents we live on a placid island of ignorance in the midst
of black seas of infinity and it was not meant that we should voyage far
the sciences each straining in its own direction have hitherto harmed us little
but some day the piecing together of dissociated knowledge will open up such
terrifying vistas of reality and of our frightful position therein that we shall
either go mad from the revelation or flee from the light into the peace and safety
of a new dark age
